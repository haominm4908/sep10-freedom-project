# Tool

For my FP tool, I picked Aframe as it had fulfilled my needs in successfully demonstrating my FP topic. The ability to make 3D models and use them to demonstrate things is what made Aframe stand out from other tools. I Thoroughly looked through Afram and found it interesting to build with. Since it is [built on HTML and a bit of Javascript](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/), it will be tedious to make things look at least properly working. Some of the projects that were built with Aframe that I viewed and played around with gave me an idea of what the tools capabilities are. Such examples are: [this cool rendering](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/webgpu/), [this model viewer](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/modelviewer/), and [this finished render](https://aframe.io/examples/showcase/post-processing/). With these examples in mind, I can grasp what I can imagine and what I can make.

# Tinkering
I tinkered around with Aframe. What do I mean by tinkering? I made a whole Aframme scene. I had to get familiar with the Aframe enviroment so I watched a few videos and watched some guides. What I was able to accomplish was this: ![Scene](scene.png)
