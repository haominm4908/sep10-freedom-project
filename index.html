          <div class="border">
            <p>Mechanical engineering has gone a long way. From simple motors to moving chassis with said motors in them, except, much more advanced and complicated. Mechanics spend a long tiring day doing their jobs, and sometimes it can take a longer than usual. I decided to put my thinking cap on and said,"how about some sort of tool in expediting the workload?" I sat myself in a room and contemplated what does exist, and what doesn't. I also used a modeling tool to give a better idea of what the tool should be. Part A and Part B document this.</p>
            </div>
          <h2 class="center" id="parta">Part A:Current tools</h2>
          <div class="border">
            <p>In mechanical engineering,or even engineering in general, tools are needed to build, fix, and sometimes break down things within their field. For example, the screwdriver is a tool needed to manually drill in a screw into 2 pieces of wood to connect to each other. Here are some examples:
            </p>
            </div>
          <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
            <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
              <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Screwdriver</div>
                <div>
                <p>As mentioned before, Screwdrivers are used to help manually drill a Screw into a piece of material, and can be used to connect pieces. </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
              <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Screws,Nuts,n bolts</div>
                <div>
               <p>Screws, Nuts, And bolts are all parts needed in Engineering. Screws are used to drill into pieces of material with the help of a screwdriver or a power drill with a screw attachment. Lug nuts, are a type of fastener used for Motor vehicles, and they can be found on ones tires. Bolts are another type of fastener, that work in conjointment with nuts.</p>

                <div>
              <p>A drill, or a power drill, is a electrical tool that produces a rapid circular motion. It comes with attachment that help with various situations. It can be used to drill a hole, combined with a screw, it can screw something in. It can help fasten a bolt as well. </p>

It comes in a set of four, and is meant to help with taking wheels off for you, and storing it until you want it to be put back.</p>
